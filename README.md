## Content

This repository contains a few code snippets I use in or for Loxone.

* [SEVentilation](./SEVentilation/): PicoC code that connects a `Room Ventilation Controller` function block to an analog output. This allows to control a SEVentilation fan pair directly. It can also be used for other fans that are controlled by a 0-5 V or 0-10 V signal, where the lowest voltage is one direction, the mean voltage is stop and the highes voltage the other direction.
